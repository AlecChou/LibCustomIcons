# LibCustomIcons

**LibCustomIcons** is a lightweight library for *The Elder Scrolls Online* that allows custom icons for players. Originally part of **HodorReflexes**, this library was separated out to improve modularity and reduce overhead.

Whether you're a streamer, guild leader, or just want to stand out with a personalized icon, this library gives you that little touch of customization — shared across all supported addons.
